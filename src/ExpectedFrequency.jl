    ExpectedFrequency(ct::ContingencyResults)

Calculate expected frequencies under the assumption of independence for a contingency table.

# Arguments
- `ct::ContingencyResults`: Contingency table results

# Returns
- `DataFrame`: DataFrame containing the expected frequencies with the same structure as the input

# Notes
- For a two-way table, expected frequency for cell (i,j) is:
  E[i,j] = (row_total[i] Ã— column_total[j]) / grand_total
- If the table is one-way, returns the same frequencies as input
- Maintains original row/column names and structure

# Examples
```julia
# Create contingency table
x1 = ["A", "A", "B", "B", "B"]
x2 = [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]
ct = ContingencyTable(x1, x2)

# Calculate expected frequencies
expected = ExpectedFrequency(ct)
```
